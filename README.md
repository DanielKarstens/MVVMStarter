# MVVMStarter
The MVVMStarter Framework

This repository contains the **MVVMStarter Framework**, which is intended to be an MVVM-based C# Framework offering basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for domain classes.

The main features of the framework are:
* Viewing collections of domain classes in (configurable) Master/Details views
* CRUD functionality
* Property-level validation
* Property-dependency management (automatic updates of aggregated view properties)
* Multiple-critera object filtering
* View configuration based on current view state
* Load/save to files in JSON format

Once you have downloaded the framework, you can add domain classes (say, a **Car** class, a **Student** class, etc.) to the framework, by following the steps in the **MVVMStarter Guide** (see the *Documentation* folder).
